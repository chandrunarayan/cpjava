# Lesson Plan Thursday Feb 27th
# Differentiated Classroom

## ALL Students
* Review Expectations for Week 4
  1. Ensure completion and proper submission of [Week 1](../week1), [Week 2](../week2), [Week 3](../week3) Exercises into GitHub.  The code should work, meet the specifications, and be properly formatted.  Make sure they are complete by end of day on <u>_Friday, Feb 28th_</u>. These will be graded this weekend.
  1. [Complete the Creativity Exploration Project](../week4/homework/creativity-exploration.md) and submit to Github before class on <u>_Monday, March 2nd_</u>.

* Clarification about Fonts in-class exercise from Wednesday
  * There was a code error that made the image not appear in the sketch. It turns out that Safari browser does NOT give proper/complete error messages!
  * Moral of story - Use Chrome for all your P5JS sketch editing!
* We will cover "for" loops and "while" loops today. In general the loops can be used interchageably.  It is more appropriate to use "for" loops when you know the bounds (no. of iterations) of your loop.  If you do not know the bounds ahead of time, it is better to use "while" loops.
  * To demonstrate both loops in today's in-class work we will code the [modified moving ball](../week4/modifiedMovingBall) example. Whenever the moving ball goes over the mouse pointer in the canvas, it should change it's color from Green to Red.
