## Exercise: Recursion with Shapes and Colors


1. Write custom function and invoke it to produce repeating shapes with these qualities:
    * Function should be recursive with aproperly defined exit condition
    * Shapes are self-similar - they should not be exact but similar with small variations in scale or color for each recursive iteration
    * [Recursive Squares Example](../code/recursiveSquares)

1. Test your code and make sure it has no infinite loops or other errors
