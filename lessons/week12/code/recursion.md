## Exercise: Recursion with Shapes and Colors


1. Write custom function and invoke it to produce repeating shapes with these qualities:
    * ALL TEAMS: Function should be recursive with aproperly defined exit condition
    * ALL TEAMS: Shapes are self-similar - they should not be exact but similar with small variations in solor and scale for each recursive iteration
    * ADV TEAM: (extra credit for STD team): Shapes should have dynamic fine structure controllable by the user with an input slider.

1. Test your code and make sure it has no infinite loops or other errors
