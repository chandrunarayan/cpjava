# Week 1 Exercise

## Taijitu
### Goal 
Stretch your problem solving skills by programming a Taijitu.

### Task
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/susanev/2016_Winter_UWHCDE_p5/blob/master/lessons/week1/exercises/images/taijitu.png" alt="Image of a Taijitu drawn with p5.js">
Create a Taijitu using p5.js similar to the one shown at right. You are limited to using only one rectangle, and as many ellipses as you need. Other commands you may want to use include: `createCanvas`, `background`, `stroke`, `noStroke`, `fill`, `noFill`, `strokeWeight`.

You may work together with others in class but make sure you fully understand your own solution.

### Submission
Make sure your code is indented correctly and that most of your lines of code have a comment, then add this project to your portfolio.

### Extra Challenge
The Taijitu your wrote is probably static, using the robot exercise as a guide, add code that allows the taijitu to follow your mouse as you move it around the screen
