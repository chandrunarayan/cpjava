# CPJava - Computer Programming in Java Course

This course is designed to introduce computer programming in the Java language. Learning to use a computer language is a necessary skill for all students regardless of discipline. In this course we will teach the fundamentals of computer programming from the stand point of simulation, automation, and problem solving of real-world systems and natural processes. At the same time, the design and implementation of computer programs is taught from the context of fundamental aspects of computer science, including the development and analysis of algorithms, the development and use of fundamental data structures, the study of standard
algorithms and typical applications, and the use of logic and formal methods. 

In addition, the year-long course will cover many of the topics necessary for preparation to the AP Computer Science A (APCSA) examination in Spring of the following year. This is an introductory course in computer programming using Java. As such, no specific programming prerequisites are needed to take this course. However, additional preparation may be needed to fully prepare a student for the AP CSA exam with no prior knowledge of computer programming.

### A Reminder
We are all going through some extraordinary times due to the coronavirus.  I would like to ask you to think about those among us who are suffering due to this affliction. Let us take time to be vigilant about [wearing masks](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html) and [washing hands frequently](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html), not touching our face and avoiding being in large groups. Most of all, be calm about things beyond our control.

### Remote Classroom Tools

In our CPJava classroom we are already using tools and techniques that are naturally adapted to a remote learning format. We will continue using our already established tools and techniques for learning CPJava.  We will add to that, a video conferencing solution  to complete our toolset needed for remote learning! All applications (except email) are to be run using your Chrome Browser on your laptop.

## Course Credit

This course draws from the book Building Java Programs: A Back to Basics Approach by Stuart Reges and Marty Stepp and materials used in the the CSAwesome/TEALS curriculum. Materials are also derived from CS programs at Lowell High School in San Francisco and Boston Latin School. Significant credit is also due to the many member founders of the Processing Foundation, especially Dan Shiffman whose tireless efforts have advanced the cause for open, accessible, and free CS education across the world.
