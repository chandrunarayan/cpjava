# IDMD - Bush School Interactive Digital Media Design Course

## Course Description

Software influences all aspects of contemporary visual culture. Students will explore the essentials of Computer Programming including: cconditional control structures, iteration, data structures, functions, classes, objects, and event-driven design. We will create projects based on student interest including, but not limited to video games, installation art, and simulations of biological and social phenomena. We will learn and create using the programming language Javascript and the library p5.js, a full featured library that allows one to create interactive digital art for the web. To see examples of the interactive digital media you can create with code, [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HerCR8bw_GE) by the creators of p5.js.
