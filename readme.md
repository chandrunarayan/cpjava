## Remote Classroom Tools _*new_

In our IDMD classroom we are already using tools and techniques that are naturally adapted to a remote learning format. We will continue using our already established tools and techniques for learning IDMD.  We will add to that, a video conferencing solution  to complete our toolset needed for remote learning! All applications (except email) are to be run using your Chrome Browser on your laptop. 

1. [ZOOM for IDMD](https://zoom.us/j/5176316708) - video conferencing application - join here each day and time IDMD classes are held
2. [IDMD WEBSITE](https://chandrunarayan.github.io/idmd/) - lessons, exercises, projects, student-portfolios, references
3. [SLACK Instant Messaging](https://app.slack.com/client/TTS9Y46VC) - differentiated classroom, code extract, bug fixes, instant help, quick challenges
4. [GITHUB repository](https://github.com/) - code submissions for exercises and projects, published student portfilios
5. [Bush PORTAL](https://bush.myschoolapp.com/app/faculty#academicclass/109608285/0/bulletinboard) - links for all tools, official assignments, schedules, syllabus, grade rubric, conference appointments
6. EMAIL - check your Bush email multiple times a day. Default communication method when all else fails! 

#### A Reminder
We are all going through some extraordinary times due to the coronavirus.  I would like to ask you to think about those among us who are suffering due to this affliction. Let us take time to be vigilant about washing hands frequently, not touching our face and avoiding being in large groups. Most of all, be calm about things beyond our control. As an exercise today, please type +1 in the [#touchingface channel on Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/TTS9Y46VC/CUWD22ZCK/user_groups/SUABCEQSV) if you see me touch my face at anytime during our class, I will report results at the end of class!

## Course Description

Software influences all aspects of contemporary visual culture. Students will explore the essentials of Computer Programming including: cconditional control structures, iteration, data structures, functions, classes, objects, and event-driven design. We will create projects based on student interest including, but not limited to video games, installation art, and simulations of biological and social phenomena. We will learn and create using the programming language Javascript and the library p5.js, a full featured library that allows one to create interactive digital art for the web. To see examples of the interactive digital media you can create with code, [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HerCR8bw_GE) by the creators of p5.js.

## Course Credit

This course draws from the materials used in the UW Human Center for Design Engineering Master of Science curriculum. Significant credit is also due to the many member founders of the Processing Foundation whose tireless efforts have advanced the cause for open, accessible, and free CS education across the world.
