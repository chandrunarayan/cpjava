# CPJava - Computer Programming in Java Course

This course is designed to introduce computer programming in the Java language. Learning to use a computer language is a necessary skill for all students regardless of discipline. In this course we will teach the fundamentals of computer programming from the stand point of simulation, automation, and problem solving of real-world systems and natural processes. At the same time, the design and implementation of computer programs is taught from the context of fundamental aspects of computer science, including the development and analysis of algorithms, the development and use of fundamental data structures, the study of standard
algorithms and typical applications, and the use of logic and formal methods. 

In addition, the year-long course will cover many of the topics necessary for preparation to the AP Computer Science A (APCSA) examination in Spring of the following year. This is an introductory course in computer programming using Java. As such, no specific programming prerequisites are needed to take this course. However, additional preparation may be needed to fully prepare a student for the AP CSA exam with no prior knowledge of computer programming.

### Remote Classroom Tools

In our CPJava classroom we are already using tools and techniques that are naturally adapted to a remote learning format. We will continue using our already established tools and techniques for learning CPJava.  We will add to that, a video conferencing solution  to complete our toolset needed for remote learning! All applications (except email) are to be run using your Chrome Browser on your laptop.

### [CPJava Course Schedule 2020-2021](yearlycal) 
![alt text][schedule]

## Learning Modes
### Learning by Doing First - Student-Based Asynchronous Workflow
In this mode of learning we will simultaneously start a consolidatded student-paced session spanning multiple Java Units, supported by working on Processing projects within Paired Programming teams.  We will mostly be using this workflow model, switching to Synchronous in small bursts as directed by your teacher or as needed to support student needs.
### Doing by Learning First - Lecture-Based Synchronous Workflow
We will use this method of learning sparingly, reserved for difficult topics that might require a lecture-based instructional unit.  The lectures below are designed in that manner and always available as a reference while we live in the world of Asynchronous "Learning by Doing First" model above.

## Mini Lesson for newly admitted Upper School Students!
### [Click here to access mini lesson](lessons/minilesson)

## Typical Workflow
1. Student attends CPJava remotely via Zoom or in-person

2. There are 11 Units in this course

3. Each Unit will have student-paced asynchronous and lecture-based synchronous sessions that will guide the coverage of the content in each Unit

4. Each Unit will also have Exercises and Projects to complete on online sources.  These are assigned via the [Google classroom](https://classroom.google.com/c/MTI2MDgzMTM2MDgw)

5. Exercises are short code extracts, videos to watch etc. Projects are complete solutions (programs) that you will write to meet a given specification.

6. Complete these and submit them to Github these as directed.  Projects will always have a code submission that is due. In some cases exercises may not have a code submission, but you will still practice them online.

7. Once you complete the exercises and projects, mark them as complete in the [Google classroom](https://classroom.google.com/c/MTI2MDgzMTM2MDgw). If you actually submitted code to Github, paste a link in the Google classroom assignment before marking it as complete.

### Expectations for School Work
![alt text][schoolwork]

## Paired Programming Teams
We will be using the Paired Programming teams for team projects. ** Please provide me the Github Account usernames that you created a few weeks ago **.  The Paired Programming projects will be published at this location.  I have updated paired programming teams for the 2nd-term also keeping in mind the students remote/on-campus students and those taking the APCSA exam.

## APCSA Exam Spring 2020

[APCSA exam will be held on Friday, May 15th 1:00 PM Pacific Time](https://apcoronavirusupdates.collegeboard.org/educators/taking-the-exams/ap-exam-schedule)

Registration is now open for AP exams, which are scheduled for May of 2021. While Bush does not offer the College Board Advanced Placement® curriculum, some courses do prepare students for the content on the exams. These exams are not required or even recommended for admission to U.S. colleges. The most common reasons students would take AP exams are to satisfy entry requirements for some international universities and the possibility of earning college credit with a score of 4 or 5. 
 
Students should register below, and the registration deadline is November 2, 2020. Students should check with their college counselor or teacher if they have questions about whether a course’s content aligns with the corresponding AP exam.

* [Click Here to REGISTER - BUSH SCHOOL HAS A SPECIAL REGISTRATION SITE](https://bush.myschoolapp.com/app/pushpage/TrackPushPageEmail?s=409&snd=c92c364e-455c-423b-aeed-22e62ca564bf&url=0BC61006759208B9B17622DF9FDF43938A774A78322CD835AFA0739F73777143&lbl=here)

### [Archived Lessons](archived_lessons.md)

## Course Credit

This course draws from the book Building Java Programs: A Back to Basics Approach by Stuart Reges and Marty Stepp and materials used in the the CSAwesome curriculum. Credit for significant collaboration with CS programs taught at the Lowell High School by Art Simon in San Francisco and at the Boston Latin School by Long Nguyen is duly noted with thanks. Credit is also due to the many member founders of the Processing Foundation, especially Dan Shiffman whose tireless efforts have advanced the cause for open, accessible, and free CS education across the world.
