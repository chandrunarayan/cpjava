[_Bush School CPJava Fall Semester 2020_](https://chandrunarayan.github.io/cpjava/)

## What's happening in CPJava for the next 3 weeks of Spring 2021! (Jan 25th - Feb 12th) ??

### A. Where we left off before orientation week
* Practiced Encapsulation (Hiding) using public, protected and private keywords in the Asteroids program
* Practiced Polymorphism by overlloading and overriding methods from parent classes in the Asteroids program
* We completed Part 1 of this project at the end of this Semester.
* We will pickup Part 2 and Part 3 when we return in 2021!  
* Discuss For Each or "enhanced for" loops

### B. Study Java ArrayList 
* [Arraylist Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cnaJQR97NmguD3ZGeLL-Rum8TVj_qA0wHxEyVr37K9s/edit#slide=id.p1)
* [For Each Loop Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NTMFNzH-FB3Pfsnozkuu4lYZre3WNNLI6eAyzpNOJg8/edit#slide=id.p1)

### C. [Project Asteroids](https://chandrunarayan.github.io/sketches/AsteroidsVariableDemo/) in 3 parts:

* I Have prepared a 3-part presentation to help reinforce concepts above and introduce the application into the Asteroids project.  
* [Part1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HfHQTei9qgkBEBhNqUKqmAc6g2V3x8FDprajTp5IZuE/edit?usp=sharing), [Part2](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pPeUvTAbIjtZYvfQIv54BDuunra8H6imO654amT6NI4/edit?usp=sharing) and [Part3](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eSpNZiI6WjTBA4Jn_s_0pSicocsRXhOUnGaTOms80CM/edit?usp=sharing) helper presentations are linked here.
* [Part1 Repo](https://github.com/chandrunarayan/AsteroidsGame), [Part2 Repo](https://github.com/chandrunarayan/AsteroidsPart2) and [Part3 Repo](https://github.com/chandrunarayan/AsteroidsPart3) Github repositories are linked here.
* Part 1 establishes the base `Floater` class and the child `Spaceship` class. It also defines keyboard actions to move, rotate, and hyperspace the `Spaceship`. 
* In Part 2 you will implement the `Asteroid` class also as a child of the `Floater` class. In these classes you will override the move() method of the parent class `Floater`. This is called polymorphism. The `Asteroid`s will rotate in addition to moving across the Starfield. 

* In Part 3, you will also create the `Bullet` class. You will also implement the ability to shoot asteroids from your Spaceship! The `Bullet`s will move in a straight line to the `Asteroid` to demolish it (or miss it!). For explosion effects, you will create a generic `Particle` class which can be used for the `Spaceship` exhaust and explosion of the `Asteroid`. Finally and time permitting, will convert all of the Asteroid Game project classes to use the `Vector` class.


### D. Additional Java Coding Practice (Optional - unless taking APCSA exam! Have you applied for the exam?)
* New Codingbat exercises being developed ...

### E. For APCSA exam ** Units 1 2 3 4 5 6 & 7 instructional videos have been released! ** Access [College AP Daily Videos](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/classroom-resources?course=ap-computer-science-a) here.
