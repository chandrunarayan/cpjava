[_Bush School CPJava Fall Semester 2020_](https://chandrunarayan.github.io/cpjava/)

# What's happening in CPJava for the rest of this term! (Dec 1st - Dec 18th) ??


## Where are we ??
![alt text][wearehere]

## A. We will make progress on Vectors and Physics by writing our first Java program on dropping weights on to a rough terrain

* Here we will learn about using Java ArrayList to create dynamic collections of objects and to iterate through them.
* We will continue to complete our discussion on Inheritance and Encapsulation with the Protected keyword.

## B. [Project Starfield](https://github.com/chandrunarayan/Starfield)
For this project you will make a animation of moving through a starfield. It is very similar to viewing an exploding firework headon as the explosion ejects particles in a 3D sphere. We will do a simulation of this in our project in 2D. The detailed specification of this project is available to you at the link above.


## C. Additional Java Coding Practice (Optional - unless taking APCSA exam! Have you applied for the exam?)
* Students taking the APCSA exam in May 2021 should be starting work on condingbat exercises.  Try your utmost to do the problems yourself without looking at the solution code.  This is important.
* I recommend this for all students who might be interested or need additional help or clarification. You can look at the solution code available to help you along.
* Make sure you have [completed all of the setup instructions Part 2 - #4 for codingbat](https://classroom.google.com/c/MTI2MDgzMTM2MDgw/a/MTI3MDIzMTA3OTY4/details). I believe you have done this already. 
* Make sure you login to codingbat with your bush school email id you already registered with
* Please note that these do not count towards your grade but will help you in clarifying concepts in this class. It is very important if you are taking the APCSA exam.
