# What's happening in CPJava this week and next week (Nov 2nd - Nov 13th) ??
![alt text][wearehere]
## A. We will complete Unit 6 in the student-paced module [Unit 6a Arrays](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16rYe06ohSndVfIjs3WSlVSaD_h0CjnMLGbMfvEbcggI/edit#slide=id.p1) and [Unit 6b Arrays of Objects](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bhgbqk9DAEzQG5ZFXYlGQ4CqQfVvieKUeOftVlC7P2Q/edit#slide=id.p1)

* Please respond to prompts from the session by providing answers as requested
* We will create at least 2 Practice Programs along the way
    * Rising Bubbles
    * Biased Walker with Collisions
* Please submit the above to the Practice Repository

## B. We will commence Unit 9a in the stusent-paced module [Unit 9a Inheritance & Encapsulation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1APHiU8WDTsL6ll2f2R2uBWW79uEhsPXPJZxobfls5lM/edit#slide=id.p1)

* Here we will learn about "evolution" of classes via extending a parent object to a child object - just like what you might observe in nature.
* We will also study Accessor (getter) and Mutator (setter) methods that will allow view and modification of Object properties.
* Starting next week we will start work on the [Starfield Project](https://github.com/chandrunarayan/Starfield) It is ready for you now if you want to get a headstart!

## C. [Project Chemotaxis!](https://classroom.google.com/u/0/c/MTI2MDgzMTM2MDgw/a/MjAzNTY2MjYyMzk3/details)
Chemotaxis is when an organism moves toward or away from a chemical stimulus like food. Biologists write software using random walks to model and study how very small organisms like bacteria search for food. In this project you will create a simulation of organisms moving away from a starting position using a random walk.

You will get to use Arrays of Objects amd more complex uses for Objects, Constructors and Methods!

## D. Additional Java Coding Practice (Optional - unless taking APCSA exam!)
* Students taking the APCSA exam in May 2021 should be starting work on condingbat exercises.  Try your utmost to do the problems yourself without looking at the solution code.  This is important.
* I recommend this for all students who might be interested or need additional help or clarification. You can look at the solution code available to help you along.
* Make sure you have [completed all of the setup instructions Part 2 - #4 for codingbat](https://classroom.google.com/c/MTI2MDgzMTM2MDgw/a/MTI3MDIzMTA3OTY4/details). I believe you have done this already. 
* Make sure you login to codingbat with your bush school email id you already registered with
* Please note that these do not count towards yoru grade but will help you in clarifying concepts in this class

    1. [Codingbat Practice Java Code for using Integers and Booleans](https://classroom.google.com/c/MTI2MDgzMTM2MDgw/a/MTk3NzI4NzgwMjYx/details)
    1. [Codingbat Practice Java Code for using Arrays](https://classroom.google.com/c/MTI2MDgzMTM2MDgw/a/MTk3NzI4NzgwNDYz/details)

## E. For APCSA exam ** Units 1 2 3 & 4 instructional videos have been released! ** Access [College AP Daily Videos](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/learning-development/ap-classroom/ap-daily) here.
