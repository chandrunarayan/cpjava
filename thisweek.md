[_Bush School CPJava Fall Semester 2020_](https://chandrunarayan.github.io/cpjava/)

# What's happening in CPJava for the rest of this term! (Dec 1st - Dec 18th) ??


## Where are we ??
![alt text][wearehere]

## A. Where we left off before the Thanksgiving break
* Learned about Inheritance (Parent-Child) using the "extends" keyword
* Practiced using inheritance in the Wiggler program and Starfield Project
* Learned about Encapsulation (Hiding) using public and private keywords
* Practiced using encapsulation in the Dodads and Thingies programs
* We learned to write getter and setter functions to expose provate objects to client programmers in a secure way
* Learned the basics of Vectors and its applicability to simulation of real-world moving objects. We studied how to model movement using location, velocity and acceleration Vectors.
* We are now READY to apply many of these concepts in our Final Asteroids Project for the Semester!
* We will complete Part 1 of this project by the end of this Semester.  We will pickup Part 2 when we return in 2021!
* I Have prepared a 2-part presentation to help reinforce concepts above and introduce the application into the Asteroids project.  [Part1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HfHQTei9qgkBEBhNqUKqmAc6g2V3x8FDprajTp5IZuE/edit?usp=sharing)  and [Part2](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pPeUvTAbIjtZYvfQIv54BDuunra8H6imO654amT6NI4/edit?usp=sharing) are linked here.

## B. [Project Asteroids](https://github.com/chandrunarayan/AsteroidsGame)
In this project we will start to replicate the old video game Asteroids. You will write a program that has a space ship that can be controlled by a player. The spaceship canbe navigated through a field of stars.  The spacehip enters an Asteroid field. The stars are stationary, the spaceship and the asteroid have very different movements. The player can navigate the spaceship throught he asteroid field and destroy them with a gun.  Part 1 of this project will create the Asteroid, Star, and Spaceship class where Asteroid and Spaceship are inherited from a top-level Floater class. Part 1 will also implement the movement of both Spaceship and Asteroid in addition to the rotation of Asteroids. Start this project by cloning the [AsteroidsGame Github repository linked here](https://github.com/chandrunarayan/AsteroidsGame).


## C. Additional Java Coding Practice (Optional - unless taking APCSA exam! Have you applied for the exam?)
* Students taking the APCSA exam in May 2021 should be starting work on condingbat exercises.  Try your utmost to do the problems yourself without looking at the solution code.  This is important.
* I recommend this for all students who might be interested or need additional help or clarification. You can look at the solution code available to help you along.
* Make sure you have [completed all of the setup instructions Part 2 - #4 for codingbat](https://classroom.google.com/c/MTI2MDgzMTM2MDgw/a/MTI3MDIzMTA3OTY4/details). I believe you have done this already. 
* Make sure you login to codingbat with your bush school email id you already registered with
* Please note that these do not count towards your grade but will help you in clarifying concepts in this class. It is very important if you are taking the APCSA exam.

    1. [Codingbat Practice Java Code for using Integers and Booleans](https://classroom.google.com/c/MTI2MDgzMTM2MDgw/a/MTk3NzI4NzgwMjYx/details)
    1. [Codingbat Practice Java Code for using Arrays](https://classroom.google.com/c/MTI2MDgzMTM2MDgw/a/MTk3NzI4NzgwNDYz/details)
    1. Other codingbat exercises being developed ...

## D. For APCSA exam ** Units 1 2 3 4 & 5 instructional videos have been released! ** Access [College AP Daily Videos](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/learning-development/ap-classroom/ap-daily) here.
