# Final Project

_[Code Due Sunday, 03/12, at 9pm](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1099807/assignments/3624548)_

_[Presentation, Monday, 03/13, at 6pm](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1099807/assignments/3624549)_

### Goals
* Demonstrate success and learning in p5.js
* Demonstrate knowledge of variables, functions, parameters, conditional statements, loops, and arrays
* Demonstrate the ability to learn and explore new concepts and topics not explored in class
* Demonstrate successful communication and the ability to work with others
* Practice informal usability studies
* Practice presenting to others

### Prework
* Generate a list or sketches (or both!) of your project ideas, think big, I will help you scope down your project next week
* General topics you might explore: Games, Puzzles, Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Stories, Digital Prototype, Data Visualizations, Text Generators, Educational experience, Twitter bot, Generative art ...
* Post your ideas to the Slack channel to share with others and find a partner

### Specification
* You must maintain a Trello board throughout the project that tracks what you are planning to do, what you are wokring on, and what you are done with (along with anything else your group would like to track)
* Each partner must push edits/changes to Github for everyday that they work on something
* Your project must be unique and based on your own ideas, consulting web resources is highly recommended, but make sure your project is not the same as something else you found
* Your project must demonstrate your ability to use variables, functions, parameters, conditional statements, loops, and arrays in your code
* You must conduct at least 5 informal usability sessions, to get user feedback and make changes (this is required content for your presentation)
* You must work together with your partner, you are welcome to split up work, but you should be connecting frequently and you both must fully understand every aspect of the code
* Your group must show movement forward in your project each week (you will demo your project to me each week)

### Optionals
* Create and submit a video showcasing your project (this can be anywhere from 2 - 6 minutes, depending on the project). The video should demonstrate a run-through of the program, with a voice talking through what is happening
	* You can record a video, or use screen recording software (I recommend [screencast-o-matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/))
	* Note: You will be evaluated on your ability to tell the story of a user using your project, not on the execution of your video

### Code Submission
* Your code should have a top comment block with your name, last edited date, and a brief description of the entire program
* Each line in setup and draw should have a comment
* Each function that you created should have a top comment briefly explaining what that function does (note that setup and draw do not need top comments)
* Any complicated parts of your code should have line comments
* Add your final project to your Github personal portfolio and submit a link to your project on Canvas
