### A Reminder
We are all going through some extraordinary times due to the coronavirus.  I would like to ask you to think about those among us who are suffering due to this affliction. Let us take time to be vigilant about [wearing masks](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html) and [washing hands frequently](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html), not touching our face and avoiding being in large groups. Most of all, be calm about things beyond our control.
