[_Bush School CPJava Fall Semester 2023_](https://chandrunarayan.github.io/cpjava/)

# What's happening in CPJava this week and next week (Nov 16th - Nov 27th) ??


## Where are we ??
![alt text][wearehere]

## A. We will continue to work on Unit 9a in the student-paced module [Unit 9a Inheritance & Encapsulation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1APHiU8WDTsL6ll2f2R2uBWW79uEhsPXPJZxobfls5lM/edit#slide=id.p1)

* Here we will learn about "evolution" of classes via extending a parent object to a child object - just like what you might observe in nature.
* We will also study Accessor (getter) and Mutator (setter) methods that will allow view and modification of Object properties.

## B. The following simple tasks below are all due BEFORE Thanksgiving break on Nov 24th. These tasks should take you, on average, 15 minutes each to complete

   1. [Complete the Impromptu Quiz on Inheritance](https://classroom.google.com/c/MTI2MDgzMTM2MDgw/a/MjMxNDc5NzgxNTM5/details)
   This should already be complete! Did you submit your quiz as a Zip file to your Practice Repository?

   1. [Complete Encapsulation Worksheet](https://classroom.google.com/c/MTI2MDgzMTM2MDgw/a/MjIyMjY1NjMyOTU1/details)

   1. [Complete Inheritance Worksheet](https://classroom.google.com/c/MTI2MDgzMTM2MDgw/a/MjIyMjgxMjU1MzYy/details)

   1. [Complete the Wiggler Encapsulation Practice Program Slides 89-95](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1APHiU8WDTsL6ll2f2R2uBWW79uEhsPXPJZxobfls5lM/edit#slide=id.g4479a0a91b_8_223)

   1. [Complete Doodads Encapsulation Practice Program](https://classroom.google.com/c/MTI2MDgzMTM2MDgw/a/MjIyMjgxMjU1NDA3/details)

   1. [Complete Thingies Encapsulation Practice Program](https://classroom.google.com/c/MTI2MDgzMTM2MDgw/a/MjIyMjgxMjU1NDgx/details)

## C. [Project Starfield](https://github.com/chandrunarayan/Starfield)
For this project you will make a animation of moving through a starfield. It is very similar to viewing an exploding firework headon as the explosion ejects particles in a 3D sphere. We will do a simulation of this in our project in 2D. The detailed specification of this project is available to you at the link above.

## D. [Transition to Vectors and Physics](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H_v-gJwiZyaRqGt4j-gnPoGeW3QGNZEhcqAEEO4Nzf0/edit#slide=id.p)
We will commence sstablishing the foundations for programming with vectors and introduce physics to simulate nature.  We will no longer move objects on a screen instead have nature take its course. In other words, all objects in the real world (and in our computer) will be completely at rest or in a state of uniform motion unless and until acted upon by a Force!  We will begin by modifying our latest program or project we have already developed to use Vectors and Forces.  We will follow the [Nature of Code online book](https://classroom.google.com/c/MTI2MDgzMTM2MDgw/m/MjMyOTg4MzYzNjU0/details) as we start to introduce Vectors and Physics into our code simulating nature.  This will lead to a progression of Java programs culminating with a Machine Learning project next Semester.  Please note that this online book is copyrighted.  I have purchased adequate online copies for our CPJava class.  Please do not distribute this book to anyone outside of our classroom including others at Bush School.
## E. Additional Java Coding Practice (Optional - unless taking APCSA exam! Have you applied for the exam?)
* Students taking the APCSA exam in May 2021 should be starting work on condingbat exercises.  Try your utmost to do the problems yourself without looking at the solution code.  This is important.
* I recommend this for all students who might be interested or need additional help or clarification. You can look at the solution code available to help you along.
* Make sure you have [completed all of the setup instructions Part 2 - #4 for codingbat](https://classroom.google.com/c/MTI2MDgzMTM2MDgw/a/MTI3MDIzMTA3OTY4/details). I believe you have done this already. 
* Make sure you login to codingbat with your bush school email id you already registered with
* Please note that these do not count towards your grade but will help you in clarifying concepts in this class. It is very important if you are taking the APCSA exam.

    1. [Codingbat Practice Java Code for using Integers and Booleans](https://classroom.google.com/c/MTI2MDgzMTM2MDgw/a/MTk3NzI4NzgwMjYx/details)
    1. [Codingbat Practice Java Code for using Arrays](https://classroom.google.com/c/MTI2MDgzMTM2MDgw/a/MTk3NzI4NzgwNDYz/details)
    1. Other codingbat exercises being developed ...

## F. For APCSA exam ** Units 1 2 3 4 & 5 instructional videos have been released! ** Access [College AP Daily Videos](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/learning-development/ap-classroom/ap-daily) here.
